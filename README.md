## Known issues / room for improvement
- The layout and iconography of the app could be optimized
- Error handling is implemented in a very basic way, not stating specific error reasons
- On Android versions requiring storage permissions the user needs to tap on the share / save buttons another time, if the permission was just granted
- Images are saved to the gallery when trying to share for simplicity reasons
